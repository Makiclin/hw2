Assignment: Rename the x and y variables h and s (for "hue" and "saturation"). In your README.me file, answer: what changes in the animation? What if you change them to nonsense names, like "dog" and "cat"?

nothing changed. The name of the varible is just for us to recognize, it won't affect the function.
